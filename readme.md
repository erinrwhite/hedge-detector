# Hedge Detector

Here's a quick way to look for hedges in your writing. 

From [Hedging (Linguistics) on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28linguistics%29):

    A hedge is a mitigating word or sound used to lessen the impact of an utterance. Typically, they are adjectives or adverbs, but can also consist of clauses.

Linguist [Robin Lakoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Lakoff) theorized that women use hedges and other linguistic methods as a response to pressure to appear "feminine" in a male-dominated world.
